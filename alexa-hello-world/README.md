This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic Hello World skill.
The goal is that Alexa greets a person, where we want to specify the name of the person. On sentences like 
- "Alexa, tell Hello World to say hello." 
Alexa should react with
- "Hello {personName}, good day/evening/morning," depending on the time of day.
